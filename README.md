Tools Used: SQL, Power BI / Excel
Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, KPI Development, Trend Analysis, Visualization

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to understand revenue performance, customer behavior, and product-level insights. SQL was used for data extraction, cleaning, and KPI calculation, while Power BI/Excel was used for building an interactive dashboard that enables quick decision-making.

Objectives

Analyze overall sales performance and revenue trends

Identify best-selling and least-selling pizzas

Study customer ordering patterns (daily and hourly trends)

Understand category-wise and size-wise contribution to revenue

Develop a dashboard that supports business decisions related to operations, inventory, and promotions

Data Cleaning & Preparation (Using SQL)

Removed duplicate order records

Fixed inconsistent date and time formats

Standardized category and size labels

Handled missing or null values

Validated totals by comparing row counts before and after cleaning

Ensured each order_id mapped correctly to quantity and price

This ensured accurate calculations and reliable visual representation.

Key KPIs Developed

Total Revenue – Overall revenue generated from all orders

Average Order Value (AOV) – Revenue per unique order

Total Pizzas Sold – Sum of all pizza quantities ordered

Total Orders – Count of distinct orders placed

Average Pizzas per Order – Ratio of total pizzas to number of orders

These KPIs provide a high-level view of business performance.

Analytical Insights & Visuals

Daily Order Trend: Identifies which days of the week receive the highest order volume.

Hourly Order Trend: Highlights peak periods, typically during lunch and dinner hours.

Sales by Pizza Category: Displays which categories (e.g., Classic, Supreme) contribute the most to revenue.

Sales by Pizza Size: Shows size preference among customers and indicates which sizes influence revenue most.

Top 5 Best Sellers: Identifies pizzas with the highest demand.

Bottom 5 Sellers: Highlights items with low performance that may require review or removal.

Tools & Techniques Used

SQL: Used for data extraction, cleaning, aggregation, and KPI calculation.

Power BI / Excel: Utilized for visualization through KPI cards, bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.

Business Analysis: Interpreting trends to support decisions on menu optimization, marketing, and staffing.

Key Business Insights

Medium and large pizzas contribute significantly to overall revenue.

Peak order times align with typical lunch and dinner hours, indicating staffing and inventory requirements.

A small group of pizzas consistently drives most revenue, signaling areas for targeted promotions.

Low-performing pizzas may require recipe modification, promotion, or removal to reduce wastage.
